- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DiegoOzuna (Diego)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested developing data driven Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence Models to address complex problems in decision making.
- ðŸŒ± My journey in data science began when I have had a wonderful opportunity at University of California- Riverside as a data science PATH research fellow. Ever since then, I have been an Undergraduate Research Assistant for data science projects at California State University San Bernardino, Lousiana State University, and Purdue University all under industry and faculty mentors. I have also done an independent study on the utilization of Long-Short Term Memory Models on classifying users who would default on payments based on six months of credit history.
