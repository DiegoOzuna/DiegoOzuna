- 👋 Hi, I’m @DiegoOzuna (Diego)
- 👀 I’m interested in video games such as Naraka Bladepoint and shooters (CoD/BattleField). Also I enjoy games like Eldenring and the darksouls series.
- 🌱 I have had a wonderful opportunity at University of California- Riverside as a data science PATH research fellow. I plan to become more invested in the data science field.
- 💞️ I’m looking to create more programs that are data driven or help with common day issues :).
